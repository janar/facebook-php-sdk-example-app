This works with PHP SDK (v.3.0.0) at moment.

Read blogpost about it @ http://eagerfish.eu/example-facebook-iframe-app-using-graph-api-through-php-sdk/

Check it out @ http://apps.facebook.com/test-graph-api-app/

SETUP NOTES:
1. Download latest 'facebook.php' (php-sdk) from github and place it next to index.php. 
url: https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/blob/master/src/facebook.php

2. Setup your app in facebook as iframe app

3. Fill in config.php which variables should be pretty much self explanatory. Values can be found here after clicking on your app.
